pi-rover
========

Node.js project for controlling my raspberry pi rover

At the moment only the movement is (semi) done. Need code to init the camera, and also limit the user to one person at a time, by using sockets.io.js

Requirements:
(1) MJPEG streamer. See http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi to set it up
